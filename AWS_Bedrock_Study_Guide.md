## üß¨ Key Concepts

| Feature                | Description |
|------------------------|-------------|
| **Foundation Models (FMs)** | Pre-trained large language models from providers like Anthropic (Claude), AI21, Cohere, Meta (LLaMA), Stability AI, and Amazon (Titan). |
| **No Infrastructure Management** | You don‚Äôt need to provision GPUs, manage servers, or scale resources. |
| **Multi-Model Access** | Access multiple top-performing FMs from one API. |
| **Custom Models** | You can customize a model with your data without training from scratch (via fine-tuning or embedding your knowledge). |
| **Secure & Private** | Bedrock runs in your AWS environment, with VPC support, encryption, and CloudWatch logging. |

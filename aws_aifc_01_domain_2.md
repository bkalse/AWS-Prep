### Task Statement 2.1: Explain the Basic Concepts of Generative AI

#### 🧠 Foundational Generative AI Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tokens** | Small units of text (words or subwords) used by models to process language. |
| **Chunking** | Dividing input data into manageable parts for processing or training. |
| **Embeddings** | Vector representations of text, images, or audio capturing semantic meaning. |
| **Vectors** | Mathematical arrays representing input data in multi-dimensional space. |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Designing input prompts to guide model output effectively. |
| **Transformer-based LLMs** | Large Language Models using transformer architecture (e.g., GPT, BERT). |
| **Foundation Models** | General-purpose models trained on vast data that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. |
| **Multi-modal Models** | Models handling more than one type of input (e.g., text and image). |
| **Diffusion Models** | Models that generate new data by iteratively refining random noise (used in image generation). |

#### 💡 Use Cases for Generative AI Models
- Text summarization
- Code generation
- Chatbots and customer service agents
- Machine translation
- Image, video, and audio generation
- Personalized search and recommendations

#### 🔁 Foundation Model Lifecycle
1. **Data Selection** – Choose diverse and relevant data.
2. **Model Selection** – Select architecture suited for task.
3. **Pre-training** – Train on large generic datasets.
4. **Fine-tuning** – Adjust model on domain-specific data.
5. **Evaluation** – Assess performance on benchmarks.
6. **Deployment** – Make model available for use.
7. **Feedback** – Collect user input and retrain as needed.

### Task Statement 2.2: Understand Capabilities and Limitations of Generative AI

#### ✅ Advantages
- **Adaptability** – Handles various tasks with little or no retraining.
- **Responsiveness** – Generates context-aware outputs.
- **Simplicity** – Reduces need for complex rules or hard coding.

#### ❌ Limitations
- **Hallucinations** – Generating factually incorrect content.
- **Interpretability** – Difficult to understand how models reach conclusions.
- **Inaccuracy** – Outputs may lack precision or reliability.
- **Nondeterminism** – Outputs may vary for same input.

#### 🧩 Factors in Selecting Models
- Model capabilities (text, image, multimodal)
- Performance requirements
- Compute constraints
- Compliance and safety considerations

#### 📊 Business Value & Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Cross-Domain Performance** | Ability to generalize across tasks and industries. |
| **Efficiency** | Cost and time savings. |
| **Conversion Rate** | Success in driving business outcomes. |
| **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)** | Financial gain per user of generative system. |
| **Accuracy** | Relevance and correctness of outputs. |
| **Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)** | Long-term value delivered by enhanced customer experience. |
